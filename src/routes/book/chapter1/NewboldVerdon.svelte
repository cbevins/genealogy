<P>
    Leicestershire is a county in the English Midlands. The village of Newbold Verdon has a population of 3,012 in 2011.
</P><P>
    According to Wikipedia:
</P><P>
    New Verdon was an agricultural center until 1850's, when coal mining became predominant.
</P><P>
    In the itinerary of 1280, Newbold, Brascote, Naneby and Barlestone answered collectively as one village, which contained 80 acres of woodland and a vineyard.
</P><P>
    A part of Newbold was enclosed in 1509, although the main enclosure took place in 1810 when the church was awarded 1,316 acres of glebe land (used to support the parish priest and any other church endeavors).
</P><P>
    Framework knitters were operating in the village in 1812, and by 1845 over 60 frames were in existence. By then, coal was being mined in the neighboring villages and many abandoned their frames and drifted into the mines.
</P><P>
    Like many other villages Newbold was almost self supporting having its own tailors, blacksmith and wheelwright, butchers and shoemakers.

US Federal Census Records

The 1850 USFC, recorded 12 Aug, 1850, states ‘William Bevans’ (sic), aged 36, was residing in Townsend, Huron, OH, USA along with his inferred spouse, ‘Mary Bevans’, aged 30.  Both he and his wife were born in England and could not read or write.
